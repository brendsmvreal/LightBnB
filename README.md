# LightBnB Project

LightBnB is a simple version of AirBnb. It allows users to rent their own properties and rent other users properties. The purpose of the project was using an ERD to design and create the database from top-to-bottom. This application was developed to practice building and understanding full-stack interactions into a true relational database managed through PostgreSQL.
